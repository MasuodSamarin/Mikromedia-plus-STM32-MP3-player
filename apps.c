/*
 * This function is a very simple text viewer, which can only open txt files.
 * Its design is similar to a file manager function. First, it tries to
 * calculate the total number of lines in the txt file. A file reaches its end
 * either when the last pixel of last written character trespassed the line's
 * border or when a newline symbol is reached. The screen can display 10 lines
 * of text with the standard 24p font we use. So, each 10 lines of text are
 * considered a page. When we reach the start of new page we write its location
 * in file in an array called "pages" which should store all pages of file. We
 * fill this array when we scan the file for the first time. So, once the file
 * is scanned, the user can easily navigate by pages and the viewer can easily
 * display them by navigating to a location stored in "pages" and then reading
 * characters byte by byte from it until the screen is completely filled. The
 * most complex part of this function is that the line counting and line
 * displaying should count/display the same number of lines (and characters on
 * each line).
 * The function can only display ASCII characters (visible ones and horizontal
 * tab which is interpreted as a single space). Any other character except
 * newline, which starts a new line immediately, is ignored and not displayed
 * at all. This means that some symbols may be ignored even when file was saved
 * as plain text since there are different encoding schemes.
