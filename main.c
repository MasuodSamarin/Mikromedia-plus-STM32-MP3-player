/*
 * INFO:
 * This code requires STM32F4 Standard Framework freely available from ST
 * Electronics.
 *
 * I should note that since this example uses the framework functions, it is
 * not the fastest code possible. In fact, it's possible to do the same things
 * it does a lot faster if you directly access the registers instead of using
 * the functions from the framework. However, those functions make the code
 * much more readable, reusable, easier to create and delay they result in is
 * usually insignificant. However, if you need more performance, you would
 * definitely prefer to directly access the registers rather than use the
 * framework.
 *
 * The MCU is configured to run at maximum speed (168 Mhz) in
 * stm32f4xx_StdFrameworkConfig.h, which means that timers are configured
 * assuming the maximum speed. There is more information on that in "delay.c".
 * Also data and instruction caches are enabled along with prefetch buffer.
 *
 * The first thing that gets executed is the content of stm32f4xx_Startup.c. It
 * sets the configuration defined in stm32f4xx_StdFrameworkConfig.h, such as
 * clock frequencies and then it jumps to the main function of this program.
 *
 * This example is made specifically for Mikromedia+ for STM32 ARM development
 * board, but it should be easy to fit for another board or project.
