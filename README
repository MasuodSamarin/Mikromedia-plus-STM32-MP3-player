This code is a firmware for Mikromedia+ for STM32 by Mikroelektronika.
The page of the board: http://www.mikroe.com/mikromedia/plus/stm32/
It contains an MP3-player with a graphical touch screen interface. It allows
browsing files and folders on a microSD-card, play audio files and open plain
text files.

It contais a lot of documentation embedded in code and also several stand-alone
code examples that aren't used by the firmware. It can also be used with other
boards based on STM32 ARM Cortex-M4 family microcontrollers (some changes, most
likely, will be required depending on board/project). This project provides
examples for the following additional controllers:

- SSD1963 Solomon Systech's screen controller
- STMPE610 Touch screen controller by ST Electronics
- VS1053 audio codec by VLSI

This project is created with CooCox CoIDE: http://www.coocox.org/CooCox_CoIDE.htm
It should be compiled with GCC, preferrably with hardware floating point operations
enabled. Please read this FAQ: http://www.coocox.org/FAQ/FAQ.html for instructions
on installing CoIDE and compiling projects with GCC.

This code uses the following third-party components:
- FatFS module from Chan.
